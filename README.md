# ObjectDetection
To perform object detection using ImageAI, all you need to do is  Install Python on your computer system Install ImageAI and its dependencies 3. Download the Object Detection model file  4. Run the sample codes (which is as few as 10 lines)  Now letâ€™s get started.  1) Download and install Python 3 from official Python Language website  https://python.org  2) Install the following dependencies via pip:  i. Tensorflow  pip install tensorflow  ii. Numpy  pip install numpy  iii. SciPy  pip install scipy  iv. OpenCV  pip install opencv-python  v. Pillow  pip install pillow  vi. Matplotlib  pip install matplotlib  vii. H5py  pip install h5py  viii. Keras  pip install keras  ix. ImageAI  pip3 install https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/2.0.2/imageai-2.0.2-py3-none-any.whl  3) Download the RetinaNet model file that will be used for object detection via this link.  Great. Now that you have installed the dependencies, you are ready to write your first object detection code. Create a Python file and give it a name (For example, FirstDetection.py), and then write the code below into it. Copy the RetinaNet model file and the image you want to detect to the folder that contains the python file.  FirstDetection.py
